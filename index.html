                <h3>Video Editing</h3>
                <p>The start of my video editing journey began when I was 15 years old and due to the pandemic we had to submit a lot of school-projects in a video format. To standout I had to make my videos engaging and entertaining, which is when I started learning about video production and editing. I am proficient with softwares such as iMovie, Final Cut Pro X, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects etc.</p>

Ever since, I have played personally and with my school band.</p>
